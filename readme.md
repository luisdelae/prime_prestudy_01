THE FUNCTION CHALLENGE + GIT

For this assignment, you will need to create an HTML / CSS / and Javascript files. The HTML only need to have a header that reads "Function Challenge" with just a little styling in the CSS. Then, create a function in the Javascript that console logs out "Hey this works!". Then you will need to check in the project into a personal GitHub repo (Note: NOT GitHub pages). Make sure to name the Repo "prime_prestudy_01".

The goal of this assignment is to prove that you have a handle on how all of the pages 'link' together and that you can get a project posted to GitHub.
